Honey Pot Spam Protection Field
===============================

Add this field to any form to introduce spam protection. It is a css-hidden field, which will fail validation if filled out.


To protect PageComments (SS 2.4+), simply add the following to your _config.php file:

	Object::add_extension('PageCommentInterface', 'HoneyPotProtectComments');
	
	
## TODO

 * Provide incorporation with spam protection module.
